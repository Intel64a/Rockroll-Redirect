# Rockroll-Redirect
A website using local host tunneling leads to a rockroll made in python

## How to install
Clone this repository and download ngrok. Run the ngrok binary with the port set to 8080. Make sure to run the python code with ```python main.py```. It will give you a url and put that in your browser. The good thing about ngrok is it is secure with ssl and no way of getting your actual ip.
